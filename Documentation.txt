Files Shared:
1)Log files folder  (Log files for models, 3 models are trained hence there are total 6 plots, i.e. train and validation plot for each model)
2)Configuration.yml (configuration file)
3)evaluvation.py    (to evaluvate models)
4)train.py          (to train models)

Aim : 
Given text we need to extract action that needs to be taken, action to be taken on which object and location where that object is present.
 
Solution:
1) Given a the train set, we encode all the sentences into 768-dimensional vector (dimension chosen by pre-trained SentenceBERT model) using SentenceBERT model
2) We observe that possible values for action, object and location for the sentences given in the dataset are small.
3) So these are encoded using a one hot encoder
4) 3 neural networks are trained to predict action, object and location (one model for each) given the encode sentence vector as input.So the problem statement is coverted to a 3 classification sub-problem.
5) Log files are maintained using Tensorboard
6) The weights are saved and loaded when requried for extraction from new unseen sentences.
 
Result:
1) The SentenceBERT model along with the neural network is able to correctly identify action, location and object in the given sentences.
2) We are able to achive F1 score of 1 or close to 1 for all classification
